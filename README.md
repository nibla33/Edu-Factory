# Edu-Factory
A project where python code is developed to mirror a virtual factory that can interact directly with hardware. A space to experiment and work with OT systems.


## Goals

- Learn TDD 
- Create a simple simulation of an automated system with the following components:
    - Tank with adjustable volume
    - four on/off valves
    - Two postion controlled valves.
    - A mixer.
    - A heater.
    - Sensors. (Flow, height etc)
- Program the system in such a way that it is modular and can be extended.
